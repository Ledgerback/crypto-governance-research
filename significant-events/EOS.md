### Jan 2019

The EOS referendum system for constitutional amendments went [live](https://medium.com/@eosnationbp/the-fate-of-eos-is-in-the-hands-of-token-holders-3d345147ef6) on Jan 11. So far 77 proposals have been [submitted](https://bloks.io/vote/referendums). The voting period for these proposals is flexible and specified by the submitter, some last as long as four months. The proposals with the most votes (as of Jan 31) have votes from around 2% of circulating EOS, but most proposals have very low participation (only 10 have greater than 0.5% participation). So far the most popular proposals are to [change](https://bloks.io/vote/referendums/rex4all) where the fees for short names and RAM purchases go, [delete](https://bloks.io/vote/referendums/decaf) the EOS Core Arbitration Forum, and [burn](https://bloks.io/vote/referendums/burnsaving) the inflation funds in eosio.saving (to be used for funding the worker proposal system).

### Feb 2019

The blacklist issued by the EOS Core Arbitration Forum (ECAF) in Jun 2018 was allowed to [lapse](https://medium.com/@eos42/proposed-solution-for-a-broken-blacklist-ce1c18bdf81c) when a new Block Producer was rotated in which had not configured the blacklist. This allowed one of the blacklisted addresses to move over 2 million EOS. The lapse occurred because the blacklist has been implemented as a list of addresses from which block producers will not process transactions, with each block producer being responsible for maintaining the blacklist manually. If only one top 21 BP does not have an updated blacklist, blacklisted accounts are vulnerable to being emptied. One solution that has been suggested is to "null the keys" until a decision has been made about what to do with the frozen funds. What to do with the blacklisted funds is already an issue for EOS, and the ECAF itself may be disbanded if an open referendum to "Delete the ECAF" passes (currently on 99% Yes with 2.4% of EOS having voted).

### Apr 2019

The EOS constitution was replaced with a new [user agreement](https://github.com/eosnewyork/eosuseragreement/blob/master/README.md), proposed on chain by [EOS New York](https://medium.com/eos-new-york/the-eos-user-agreement-has-been-proposed-on-chain-61bf3760b604) and [approved](https://eosauthority.com/approval/view?scope=eosnewyorkio&name=eosuseragree&lnc=en) by the 21 Block Producers. This change had been put to EOS holders in a [referendum](https://eosauthority.com/polls_details?proposal=eosuseragree_20190207&lnc=en). The referendum had a long duration (3 months) and was not due to finish until May 8, there was strong support for the proposal (98% Yes) but voter participation was very low (1.7%). EOS referendums had a notional quorum requirement of 15%, but in light of the fact that none of the polls are even close to reaching that level of participation, it seems like the BPs have decided to bypass the formal referendum process and move forward with some of the proposed changes. The EOS BPs also [approved](https://twitter.com/zeroxeos/status/1118833569118466048) the deployment of REX (Resource Exchange), but it [failed](https://www.reddit.com/r/eos/comments/bekd4f/rex_is_here_status_approved_by_15_bp/) execution on chain and will have to be re-proposed.

### May 2019

EOS Block Producers [burned](https://www.reddit.com/r/eos/comments/bm75ih/the_mainnet_34m_eos_accumulated_4_inflation_is/) 34 million EOS (~$272 million) from the eosio.saving account. These funds had accumulated from the 4% inflation which was to be used to fund project development through a [Worker Proposal System](https://medium.com/eosys/eos-worker-proposal-system-announcement-6addcfb0134c). This idea fell out of favor with the EOS BPs and community, and 15 BPs supported the proposal to burn accumulated savings [on May 8](https://www.eosx.io/tx/26ca16319febafc0942a8c6e3be26c16b84846b7cfe5f6ade906a0b86a6c2bb7?listView=actions). New tokens are still accumulating in the savings account, but this seems likely to be removed as there is an open [referendum](https://eosauthority.com/polls_details?proposal=inflation_20190307&prev=search) to remove the 4% inflation for development entirely, which has almost unanimous support from around 2.7% of EOS tokens that have voted.
