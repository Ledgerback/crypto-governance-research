Dash v0.13.1 was released on Feb 8 to "accelerate adoption of the Dash Core v0.13". Dash Core [v0.13](https://blog.dash.org/dash-core-v0-13-on-mainnet-dc9609b0f6f9) was intended to activate [DIP3](https://github.com/dashpay/dips/blob/master/dip-0003.md) but it had an activation threshold of 80% blocks signalling support from the PoW miners and masternodes in a 7 day window before activation would begin. After failing to meet these criteria for around 24 days, it was decided that the criteria are too stringent and that the requirement for masternodes to signal could be dropped. When enough PoW miners have adopted v0.13.1 the change will activate one week later, any masternodes who fail to upgrade by then will cease to receive rewards.
