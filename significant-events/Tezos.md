Tezos started [voting](https://blog.nomadic-labs.com/athens-proposals-injected.html) for the first [amendment](https://blog.nomadic-labs.com/athens-our-proposals-for-the-first-voted-amendment.html) to its protocol on February 25 ([simple guide](https://medium.com/tezos-spotlight/tezos-the-first-amendment-a-laymans-guide-7424ef1d3e13), [detailed guide](https://medium.com/tezos/amending-tezos-b77949d97e1e) to amendment process). The amendment process has 4 phases, each lasting 8 "cycles" (a cycle lasts around 3 days, so each phase lasts for around 24 days). In the first phase bakers submit and upvote proposals. There are 2 proposals being evaluated now in the first phase, they both increase the gas limit but one also decreases the minimum "roll size" (amount of XTZ required to be a baker). It is interesting to note that Kialo is being [used](https://www.kialo.com/tezos-protocol-amendment-1-25295) by some Tezos community members to discuss these proposals. When the first phase ends, the most upvoted proposal will progress to phase 2, where it must be approved by at least 80% of bakers. If the criteria are met, this is followed by a testing phase in which a testnet fork with the changes applied is created and runs for 48 hours (a further testnet matching the proposal may be run for the rest of this phase to allow further testing). After the testing phase, bakers vote on whether the changes should be activated, with an 80% supermajority required. After this 4th phase the changes are activated (or not) and the cycle begins again with new proposals.
