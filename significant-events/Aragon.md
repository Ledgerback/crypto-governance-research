The first round of voting on Aragon Governance Proposals (AGPs) has been [delayed](https://forum.aragon.org/t/agp-vote-delay-announcement/426) due to potential network instability around the Ethereum Constantinople hard fork - hopefully "blockchain down for maintenance" is not a problem Decred will encounter with Politeia. The CEO of Aragon Association [published](https://forum.aragon.org/t/agp-wishlist-and-blacklist/355) a blacklist and wishlist for proposals before proposal submissions opened. In the first proposal the AGP [process](https://github.com/aragon/AGPs/blob/master/AGPs/AGP-1.md) itself was [approved](https://blog.aragon.org/final-results-from-the-agp-1-vote/) by 99.97% of the ANT that voted. In total 2.6% of all ANT tokens voted on the first proposal, from 45 unique addresses, with ~60% of ANT votes coming from one address. AGPs go through a review by the board of the Aragon Association, then a community review, before a 48 hour voting period opens.

The first round of Aragon proposal voting [concluded](https://blog.aragon.org/final-results-from-aragon-network-vote-1/) on Jan 26. Of the 12 submitted proposals, 3 were excluded from the vote by the Aragon Foundation (1 because of lack of full time leadership and engineering talent, 2 were excluded to reduce cognitive load on voters). 8 of the 9 proposals voted on were [approved](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/governance.aragonproject.eth/0x277bfcf7c2e162cb1ac3e9ae228a3132a75f83d4) by ANT holders, with one proposal (to change the voting period duration from 48 hours to 1 week) rejected. ANT participation rates [ranged](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/governance.aragonproject.eth/0x277bfcf7c2e162cb1ac3e9ae228a3132a75f83d4) from 2.3 to 7.8%. The most expensive [proposal](https://github.com/aragon/flock/blob/master/teams/Aragon%20One/2019.md) to be approved will pay Aragon One $4 million for 2019 operating costs plus an incentive package consisting of 1.675 million ANT on a 5 year vesting schedule. An incentive in ANT with a vesting schedule was included as part of most proposals, in addition to the main cost to be paid in DAI. In total this round of approved proposals will cost around $5.94 million + 2.52 million ANT (~$880K).

The Aragon Transparency Report for Q4 2018 was [released](https://blog.aragon.org/aragon-q4-2018-transparency-report/). This report presents a detailed breakdown of spending related to the project.
