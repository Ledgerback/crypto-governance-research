The first round of Aragon proposal voting [concluded](https://blog.aragon.org/final-results-from-aragon-network-vote-1/) on Jan 26. Of the 12 submitted proposals, 3 were excluded from the vote by the Aragon Foundation (1 because of lack of full time leadership and engineering talent, 2 were excluded to reduce cognitive load on voters). 8 of the 9 proposals voted on were [approved](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/governance.aragonproject.eth/0x277bfcf7c2e162cb1ac3e9ae228a3132a75f83d4) by ANT holders, with one proposal (to change the voting period duration from 48 hours to 1 week) rejected. ANT participation rates [ranged](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/governance.aragonproject.eth/0x277bfcf7c2e162cb1ac3e9ae228a3132a75f83d4) from 2.3 to 7.8%. The most expensive [proposal](https://github.com/aragon/flock/blob/master/teams/Aragon%20One/2019.md) to be approved will pay Aragon One $4 million for 2019 operating costs plus an incentive package consisting of 1.675 million ANT on a 5 year vesting schedule. An incentive in ANT with a vesting schedule was included as part of most proposals, in addition to the main cost to be paid in DAI. In total this round of approved proposals will cost around $5.94 million + 2.52 million ANT (~$880K).
