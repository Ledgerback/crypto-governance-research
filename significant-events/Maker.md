February saw MKR holders voting in two separate 0.5% increases in the Stability Fee for Collateralized Debt Positions (CDPs). Key factors leading to the decision included a DAI exchange rate persistently below $1, high inventory levels among market makers and prop desks, and no attributable impact from previous stability fee increases. When these increases failed to have the desired effect, the Maker Foundation Interim Risk Team decided on February 28th to [propose](https://www.reddit.com/r/MakerDAO/comments/ax9dpa/governance_poll_proposed_stability_fee_increase_2/) an an additional 2% increase, for a new rate of 3.5%. A raise in the debt ceiling was also [discussed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JkJFLHOlfy8). The proposed Stability Fee increase will be put to a Governance vote on March 4th to poll MKR sentiment on the change.
