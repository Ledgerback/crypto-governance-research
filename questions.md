# Blockchain Governance

* Does the project have its own blockchain or is it a token on another chain? (many questions are not relevant for tokens)

* What is the mechanism for ensuring consensus about the state of the blockchain?

  Consensus mechanism label:

  * PoW
  * PoS
  * PoW/PoS Hybrid
  * DPoS
  * Byzantine Fault Tolerant
  * Liquid-PoS?
  * Master Nodes

* Which entities interact with the blockchain? What role does each entity play? How are the "block producers" selected?

* How were/are coins distributed? Was there an ICO? Is there inflation now? Is there a fixed supply?

* Has the project been re-branded or re-named at any point?
