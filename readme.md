The aim of this repository is to collect information about the governance of blockchain/cryptocurrency projects - first and foremost, to serve as a repository of information about where one can observe this governance in motion and learn more about it.

There are a set of questions in the [questions.md](questions.md) file which are intended to guide and structure research.

This project is currently in an early pilot stage, so the questions are subject to change, perhaps drastically. Feedback from people who apply these questions is sought and much appreciated at this stage. The questions document will undoubtedly require many iterations to reach a stage where it can be usefully applied by a variety of different researchers.

To participate in this project, choose a subject and create a file called [project.md] in the answers folder. Work through the questions for that project, answering them in a way which makes sense for that project, works as a standalone document, and **includes links to sources for as much of the information as possible**.

If a question doesn't make sense for the project you're looking at, skip it. If the question is relevant but you can't find any answer, say so in the document.

The [Decred](answers/decred.md) and [Dash](answers/dash.md) markdown documents have been prepared as examples of a reasonable effort to answer the questions well - it is worth looking at at least one of these before attempting to research and write up a project according to this methodology.

There is no requirement to achieve any specific degree of polish before opening a pull request - pull requests will be accepted where they add statements which are backed by **credible sources**. 

"Where does the governance happen?" can be regarded as the primary question, and it is fine (even encouraged!) to create a file for a project even if it only contains a list of sources where one can observe that project's governance processes in action or read about its workings in detail.
